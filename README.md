Course Syllabus
ICS 5: Global Disruption and Information Technology
Fall 2024
Course Overview:
This class explores how new forms of information technology (IT) may support transition to a sustainable civilization. Topics include design and implementation of IT systems, science of global change, online community building, and “green IT." 
This class was originally developed by three professors at UCI: Dr. Bill Tomlinson, Dr. Bonnie Nardi, and Dr. Don Patterson. Since then, many others at UCI have contributed to this class, including Juliet Norton, the staff of UCOP's Innovative Learning Technology Initiative, the staff of UCI's Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation, and other teaching staff members, past and present.
Office Hours:
During office hours, Dr. Young and the TAs are available to discuss all course materials or related questions. You can discuss your past assignments with us, or you can even bring us your upcoming assignments and we can go over them with you (this is a good way to make sure you won't miss any points). 
The readers will also hold office hours to discuss issues with specific graded assignments. <代 写ICS 5: Global Disruption and Information Technology Fall 2024

Readings:
You will have roughly 1-3 weekly readings in this class. Some reading may require you to use your campus network to access. 
For UCI: The VPN provides remote access to UCI library resources. To download the VPN client, go to: https://www.lib.uci.edu/connect. You will have better results if you download the VPN rather than using the web-based one. Note that you usually need to manually select "UCIFull" to access library resources.
For other UC's: Check your campus library for information about accessing online resources. If you are having trouble accessing course materials, please reach out to Dr. Young.
